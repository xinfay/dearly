# Dearly â€“ React + Vite + FastAPI
This project is a web application built using **React** (with **Vite** as the build tool) for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend. It includes routing via React Router and makes use of various useful packages for UI and backend request handling.

First, run 'git clone https://github.com/xinfay/dearly'

```

Under the .env file, you shouldinput your own Prinftul API key, which you may create from the Printful Developper platform
at https://developers.printful.com/. When creating your key, the access level you configure should only be to one store - this avoids conflict with pushing the same order to multiple stores.


## ðŸ“¦ Requirements & Dependencies

### Frontend (React + Vite)
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (recommended v18+).

Install these packages:
```bash
npm install
npm install react-router-dom
npm install react-select
```

This project uses:
- [`react-router-dom`](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing
- [`react-select`](https://react-select.com/) for dropdown components
- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) for HMR with Babel (can be swapped with SWC)
- ESLint rules (you can expand this setup with TypeScript and `typescript-eslint`)

### Backend (Python + FastAPI)
Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed. Then set up and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows
```

Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install requests==2.25.1
pip install python-dotenv
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```


## ðŸš€ Running the Project

### 1. Backend API (FastAPI)

In a new command prompt or bash terminal
From the backend directory (where `create_order.py` is located):

```bash
cd 'to the backend directory'
python -m uvicorn create_order:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Make sure `.env` is configured properly for your order processing environment.

To deactivate the virtual environment when done:
```bash
deactivate
```
Or run Ctrl+C to terminate the process.


### 2. Frontend (React + Vite)

In a new separate command prompt or bash terminal
From the frontend directory:

```bash
cd 'to the dearly directory'
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server. Open the provided local URL (typically [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)) to view the app.

Locally, you should just run http://localhost:5173. Fulfilling an order via Input will submit an order to the Printful API.
Likewise, run Ctrl+C to terminate the process.


## âœ… Notes

- This project uses **React Router** for navigation between `Home` and `Build` pages.
- Backend endpoints are powered by FastAPI and serve order fulfillment logic.
- Make sure both frontend and backend servers are running concurrently during development.
- ESLint is pre-configured and can be extended to include **TypeScript** and stricter linting via [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

- Add TypeScript support
- Improve error handling and validation in API
- Setup automated tests for backend and frontend
- Dockerize backend for easy deployment
